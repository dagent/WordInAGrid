  - Pick a random direction from [up,down,left,right,ul,ur,dl,dr] (parameter)
  - fill the grid with random upper-case letters
  - Put in a Word in one of the directions (parameter)

- Learn to use chatGPT (or other programming LLM) to generate some simple python code to do this.

  - **D** Word direction in the grid.
  - **W** The word to place in the grid.
